# epoch2iso

Unix Epoch times are not human readable. This script can be used in a pipeline to convert any likely epoch numbers to the ISO8601 date and time format.

There is no consideration for the meaning of the numbers, so any number in a sensisble range will be converted. This makes it handy for debugging and examining logs, but not suitable for use in a data loading pipeline.

## Requires

Perl

## Usage

usage: ./epoch2iso

Converts any epoch timestamps found in STDIN to ISO8601 times. Only times within a range of n years from now are converted. Default of 10 years.

Milliseconds are used if a sensible convertion can be made with milliseconds.

Warning: Some numbers which are not timestamps might be converted accidentally, use -y to limit window range if needed.


       -h    Print help.
       -q    Quote output with "
       -q='  Quote output with '
       -u    Print a UTC time'
       -y    Only convert times within 1 year from now.
       -y=3  Only convert times within 3 years from now.
